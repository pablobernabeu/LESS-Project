# Creation of stimuli for the experiment on gender agreement 
# administered in Session 2.

# Target trials contain the grammatical property of interest.
# Example structure: 'Ze pencil is bigezu and ze truck too'
# 
# Filler trials contain a locative adverbial clause.
# Example structure: 'The pencil is above the key and the street too'

# There are three conditions, following Gonz치lez Alonso et al. (2020; 
# https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroling.2020.100939):
# 
# 1. grammatical
# 2. gender violation
# 3. number violation
# 
# These conditions are realised in the adjective in target sentences.


# Definition of code items with regard to Gonz치lez Alonso et al. (2020)
# 
# `noun1`: the noun in the initial determiner phrase in each sentence
# 
# `noun2`: the second noun in locative filler sentences
# 
# `wrapup_noun`: the noun in the final region of sentences, which 
# begins with a conjunction. This region is used to ward off 
# sentence wrap-up effects.

# For definitions of all EEG triggers, see README.txt in the 
# 'session_materials' folder.
