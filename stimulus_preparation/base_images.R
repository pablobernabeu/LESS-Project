# Images were obtained from three sources: 
# (I) MultiPic (DuÃ±abeitia et al., 2018,
#   https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2017.1310261);
# (II) https://www.flaticon.com;
# (III) https://www.freepik.com

# All images were stored in the directory 'session_materials/images/', 
# and further distributed in the appropriate folders corresponding to 
# each study site.

# The code below is used to frame every image on a white, square 
# background to facilitate the integration of images with other 
# images, and the final composition in OpenSesame.
