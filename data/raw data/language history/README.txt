Language history files comprise raw data and aggregate scores, which are downloaded from separate sections on the LHQ3 platform. 

For project-specific requirements, after downloading the LHQ3 files, the data was split by mini-language group through a script 

located in "data/importation and preprocessing". The group-specific data was saved to Mini-English and Mini-Norwegian folders in 

"data/language history". This group-specific files do not contain any additional data over the main files in "data/language history". 

The language history data used in the analyses is from the main files in "data/language history", not from the group-specific files.
