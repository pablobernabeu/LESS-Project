Language history files comprise raw data and aggregate scores, which are downloaded from separate sections on the LHQ3 platform. 

Furthermore, after downloading the LHQ3 files, folders specific to each mini-language group were created and populated with 

group-specific data, extracted from the LHQ3 files. Thus, the data in the group-specific folders is the same as the data in the 

general files in the main "language history" folder.
