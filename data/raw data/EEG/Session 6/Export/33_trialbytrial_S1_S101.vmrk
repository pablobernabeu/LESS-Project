; Each entry: Prop<Number>=Mk<Marker number>,<Type>,<Name>,<Value>,<Value2>,...,<ValueN>
; Property number must be unique. Types can be int, single, string, bool, byte, double, uint
; or arrays of those, indicated int-array etc
; Array types have more than one value, number of values determines size of array.
; Fields are delimited by commas, commas in strings are written \1
; Properties are assigned to markers using their marker number.
