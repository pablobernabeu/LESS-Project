Inside the 'EEG' folder, the 'Raw' folder contains metadata only, as the raw data is too heavy.
The latter raw data is instead available at https://osf.io/tq7vy. The 'Export' folder contains 
data that was preprocessed in BrainVision Analyzer 2 (https://brainvision.com/products/analyzer-2). 

The 'executive functions' folder contains data that was collected in Gorilla 
(https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/782880).

The 'language history' folder contains data that was elicited using the Language History 
Questionnaire (LHQ3; https://lhq-blclab.org).
