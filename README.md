The current repository does not contain any files exceeding 100 MB, which 
is the limit per file on GitHub. This affects one file type, namely, the 
`.eeg` files that belong in the `Raw` folder. These files are instead 
available at https://osf.io/tq7vy.

This readme file contains the most general notes. Further readme files 
exist in subsequent folders. For instance, the experimenters 
facilitating the lab sessions are advised to read the readme file in 
the session_materials folder.

== Session materials ==

The stimuli are prepared in the 'stimulus_preparation' folder, and 
stored in the 'session_materials' folder, along with the OpenSesame 
file for each session.
